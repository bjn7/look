## To DO

IT IS BASE CODE
after finishing base code -> optimize , apply rayon, remov unnessary stuff

- parallel searching
- better way of displaying
- a navigation thing

A quick libary going to be use:

- tokio (for async/await basically, speed up)
- rayon ( for parallelism basically, speed up)
- rataui( for navigation )

Trying to achive 10mil+ files under a sec ;)

new to rust, going to buld it to grasp the tokio , well most of nerds build a http server or some other cool shits but from practial view,
this will be really usefull, and i will be using this myself while searching for file basically, gonna replace fileexplorer.
